3. **Data Volume**
   - Storing and processing large volumes of historical market data can be challenging and resource-intensive.


#### Back-of-the-Envelope Calculations

1. **Latency Estimation**

   - **Order Execution Latency**: Assume an execution latency of 200 microseconds for placing or canceling an order.

2. **Throughput Estimation**

   - Assume a single instance can handle 10,000 orders per second.

3. **Market Data Processing**

   - **Data Feed Rate**: Assume receiving 1,000 market updates per second per feed.
   - **Processing Latency**: Each update processed within 50 microseconds.

4. **Memory Usage**

   - **Order Book Storage**: Each order entry is 100 bytes. For 1 million active orders, memory usage is:
     - 1,000,000 orders * 100 bytes = 100 MB

5. **Scalability**

   - **Horizontal Scaling**: Adding more instances to handle additional orders and market data. If each instance can handle 10,000 orders/sec, a cluster of 10 instances can handle 100,000 orders/sec.

6. **Risk Management Overhead**

   - **Position Monitoring**: Assume monitoring 1,000 positions per second with 10 microseconds per position.
   - **Total Monitoring Time**: 1,000 positions * 10 microseconds = 10 milliseconds

7. **Network Overhead**

   - **Bandwidth per Order**: Assume each order involves 1 KB of data transfer.
   - **Bandwidth per Node**: For 10,000 orders/sec, the bandwidth requirement is:
     - 10,000 orders/sec * 1 KB = 10 MB/sec
    
### Aggregate the Total Requirements

Given these factors, let's estimate the number of nodes and their RAM:

1. **Order Processing Nodes**:
   - To handle 100,000 orders per second, we need 10 nodes (as each node handles 10,000 orders/sec).
   - Latency Requirements: Assume that each order must be processed within 200 microseconds.

### Estimating CPU Requirements

1. **Order Processing Load**

   - 10,000 orders per second
   - Assume each order processing takes approximately 200 microseconds.
   - CPU cycles needed per order: \( 200 \text{ microseconds} = 0.2 \text{ milliseconds} \).
   - Total CPU time per second: \( 10,000 \text{ orders} \times 0.2 \text{ milliseconds} = 2,000 \text{ milliseconds} = 2 \text{ seconds} \).
   - Since this is per second, a single core running at full capacity can handle this.

### CPU Cores and Frequency Calculation

To handle 2,000 milliseconds of CPU time per second, we need 3 CPU cores (2+1 for smooth operation). 

### CPU Frequency

1. **Latency Requirements**:
   - Order execution latency is 200 microseconds.
   - Modern high-performance CPUs (e.g., Intel Xeon or AMD EPYC) can achieve clock speeds around 3 GHz to 4 GHz.
   - At 3 GHz, each clock cycle is approximately \( \frac{1}{3,000} \) microseconds, or about 0.333 nanoseconds.
   
2. **Memory per Node**:
   - Each node requires at least 100 MB for order book storage.
   - Additional memory for processing and overhead, let's assume a buffer of 400 MB.
   - Total Memory per Node: \( 100 \text{ MB} + 400 \text{ MB} = 500 \text{ MB} \).

3. **Network Bandwidth per Node**:
   - Each node requires 10 MB/sec bandwidth.

### Final Node Specifications
- **CPU**: 3 cores per node, 3+ GHz frequency.  
- **Number of Nodes**: 10
- **RAM per Node**: 500 MB
- **Network Bandwidth per Node**: 10 MB/sec

### Summary

- **Latency**: Sub-millisecond latency for order execution, around 200 microseconds.
- **Throughput**: A single instance can handle 10,000 orders/sec, scaling to 100,000 orders/sec with a 10-instance cluster.
- **Memory**: Order book storage requires around 100 MB for 1 million active orders.
- **Market Data**: Processing 1,000 market updates per second with 50 microseconds latency per update.
- **Network**: Bandwidth requirement per node is around 10 MB/sec.
