### High-Frequency Trading (HFT) System Design: Cache Component

#### Limitations

1. **Network Latency**
   - Despite low-latency cache operations, network latency can still impact overall performance, especially in a geographically distributed setup.

2. **Data Consistency**
   - Ensuring strong consistency can introduce latency due to synchronization overhead. This can be a trade-off between latency and consistency.

3. **Cache Size Limits**
   - In-memory caches are limited by the amount of available RAM. Large datasets may require a careful balance between hot and cold data management.

4. **Fault Tolerance Complexity**
   - Implementing robust fault tolerance mechanisms, such as data replication and failover, adds complexity and can impact performance during failover events.

5. **Eviction and Expiry Overheads**
   - Managing data eviction and expiration policies can introduce overhead, especially under high load conditions where frequent eviction decisions are required.

6. **Scalability Limits**
   - Horizontal scaling is effective, but coordination and consistency maintenance across many nodes can become challenging as the number of nodes increases.

#### Back-of-the-Envelope Calculations

1. **Latency Estimation**

   Assume we are using Redis for our caching solution, and typical read/write latencies for Redis are sub-millisecond (e.g., 100 microseconds).

   - **Read Latency**: 100 microseconds
   - **Write Latency**: 100 microseconds (without replication)

2. **Throughput Estimation**

   Redis can handle around 100,000 operations per second (ops/sec) per instance.

   - **Single Node Throughput**: 100,000 ops/sec
   - **Cluster Throughput**: For a cluster of 10 nodes, theoretical throughput would be around 1,000,000 ops/sec, assuming even load distribution and no bottlenecks.

3. **Memory Usage**

   Let's assume each cache entry is 1 KB in size. For a single node with 64 GB of RAM, we allocate 50 GB for cache data (reserving some memory for overhead).

   - **Entries per Node**: 50 GB / 1 KB = 50,000,000 entries

4. **Scalability**

   With 10 nodes, the total cache capacity would be:

   - **Total Entries**: 10 * 50,000,000 = 500,000,000 entries

5. **Fault Tolerance Overhead**

   Assuming a replication factor of 2 (each piece of data is replicated to one other node for fault tolerance):

   - **Effective Capacity per Node**: 25 GB (since half the memory is used for replication data)
   - **Effective Entries per Node**: 25,000,000 entries
   - **Total Effective Entries in Cluster**: 10 * 25,000,000 = 250,000,000 entries

6. **Eviction Rate**

   If we set a TTL of 1 hour for cache entries and assuming a constant write rate:

   - **Evictions per Second**: If we have 250 million entries with a TTL of 1 hour, the eviction rate would be:
     - 250,000,000 entries / 3600 seconds = ~69,444 evictions/sec

7. **Network Overhead**

   Assuming each operation (read/write) involves 1 KB of data transfer:

   - **Bandwidth per Node**: For 100,000 ops/sec, the bandwidth requirement is:
     - 100,000 ops/sec * 1 KB = 100 MB/sec
   - **Cluster Bandwidth**: For 10 nodes, the total bandwidth requirement would be 1 GB/sec.

### Summary

- **Latency**: Expect sub-millisecond latency, around 100 microseconds per operation.
- **Throughput**: A single node can handle 100,000 ops/sec, and a 10-node cluster can theoretically handle 1,000,000 ops/sec.
- **Memory**: Each node with 64 GB RAM can effectively store around 25 million entries when considering replication.
- **Eviction**: The system must handle approximately 69,444 evictions per second.
- **Network**: Bandwidth requirement per node is around 100 MB/sec, scaling to 1 GB/sec for the entire cluster.

These calculations provide a high-level view of the cache component's capabilities and limitations, helping to guide more detailed design and implementation decisions.

### Market Maker Component in High-Frequency Trading (HFT)

#### Purpose

The market maker component in an HFT system plays a crucial role in financial markets by providing liquidity. Market makers are entities or systems that continuously offer to buy and sell securities, commodities, or other financial instruments, thereby facilitating trading and ensuring that there is enough liquidity in the market for other participants to trade without significant delays or price fluctuations.

Key purposes of a market maker include:

1. **Liquidity Provision**: By constantly offering to buy and sell, market makers ensure that other traders can always find a counterparty for their trades, enhancing market fluidity.
2. **Spread Capture**: Market makers earn profits by capturing the spread, which is the difference between the buy (bid) and sell (ask) prices they quote.
3. **Price Stability**: By actively trading and updating their quotes, market makers help stabilize prices and reduce volatility.
4. **Efficient Price Discovery**: They contribute to the process of price discovery by continuously updating their quotes based on market conditions and information.

#### Use Cases

1. **Stock Exchanges**: Market makers operate on stock exchanges to provide liquidity for listed equities. They ensure that there is sufficient depth in the order book so that large orders do not cause significant price disruptions.

#### Detailed Explanation of Market Maker Component

1. **Order Management System (OMS)**
   - **Order Placement**: The market maker component continuously places buy and sell orders based on the current market price and its trading strategy.
   - **Order Modification and Cancellation**: The system must be able to quickly modify or cancel orders to adapt to rapidly changing market conditions.

2. **Market Data Handler**
