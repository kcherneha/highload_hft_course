### Selection of Data Storage Models for HFT Market Maker System

### 1. Snapshots (Cassandra)
#### Requirements:
- **High Write Throughput**: Frequent updates to store real-time snapshots.
- **Horizontal Scalability**: Ability to handle increasing data volume and transaction rates.
- **High Availability**: Ensure data is available even during node failures.

#### Key Purpose:

The primary purpose is to store real-time snapshots of the market data, which includes the state of order books, trades, and other relevant financial information. Functions:

1. **Real-Time Market State Storage**:
   - The snapshots database captures the current state of the market at any given moment, including the latest bid and ask prices, trade volumes, and the order book depth.

2. **High Write Throughput**:
   - In an HFT environment, data about trades and order book changes is generated at a very high rate. Cassandra's ability to handle high write throughput makes it suitable for storing this continuously updating data efficiently.

3. **Historical Data Reference**:
   - Although primarily used for real-time data, the snapshots database can also help in referencing recent historical data for short-term analysis and decision-making.

4. **Disaster Recovery and Fault Tolerance**:
   - By capturing the state of the market at frequent intervals, the snapshots database aids in quick recovery in case of system failures. Cassandraâ€™s replication features ensure that data is available even if some nodes fail.

5. **Data Analysis and Backtesting**:
   - Snapshots of market data can be used to backtest trading algorithms against recent market conditions. This helps in refining strategies based on near-real-time historical data.

6. **Synchronization and Coordination**:
   - The database ensures that all components of the HFT system, including matching engines and risk management modules, have access to consistent and synchronized market state data.

#### Justification for Choosing Cassandra:

- **Scalability**: Cassandra is highly scalable, making it capable of handling the large volumes of data generated by HFT operations.
- **Availability**: With its decentralized architecture, Cassandra ensures high availability and fault tolerance, which are critical for an HFT system that requires continuous uptime.
- **Write Optimization**: The database is optimized for high-speed write operations, aligning with the need to frequently update the market state.


### 2. Historical Data (Time Series DB or again Cassandra - see p.5)
#### Requirements:
- **Time-Based Data**: Efficient storage and retrieval of time-series data.
- **High Insertion Rate**: Capable of handling a high rate of incoming data points.
- **Query Efficiency**: Optimized for queries over specific time ranges.

#### Key Purpose:
For future analytics and reviewing algorithms of trading.

#### Storage Model:
**Time Series Database (InfluxDB, TimescaleDB)**

#### Justification:
- **Optimized for Time-Series Data**: Time-series databases are specifically designed to handle sequential, time-stamped data, making them ideal for historical market data.
- **High Insertion Rate**: They can handle large volumes of data points with minimal latency.
- **Efficient Queries**: These databases provide optimized functions for querying and analyzing time-series data, such as rollups, aggregations, and downsampling.

### 3. Payment and Settlement Systems (RDBMS) - if needed for us (maybe in scope of this project will be implemented by outer HFT-board actor)
#### Requirements:
- **Transactionality**: Ensure ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) properties for financial transactions.
- **Relational Data**: Manage relationships between different entities (e.g., accounts, transactions).

#### Storage Model:
**Relational Database Management System (PostgreSQL, MySQL)**

#### Justification:
- **ACID Compliance**: RDBMS provides strong transactional guarantees necessary for financial operations.
- **Relational Data Handling**: Ideal for managing complex relationships between entities and enforcing data integrity.
- **Mature Ecosystem**: Well-established tools and practices for backup, recovery, and security.

### Summary
#### Selected Storage Models:
- **Snapshots**: Apache Cassandra (NoSQL Column-Family Database)
- **Historical Data**: InfluxDB or TimescaleDB (Time Series Database)
- **Payment and Settlement Systems**: PostgreSQL or MySQL (Relational Database Management System)
